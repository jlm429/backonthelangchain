    "# LangGraph Tweet Revision Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a structured, iterative loop between tweet **generation** and **critique** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and an OpenAI chat model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow simulates a conversation between:\n",
    "- An **AI assistant** that generates or revises a tweet\n",
    "- A **\"simulated human\" critic** who offers feedback on how to improve it\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph orchestrates this back-and-forth using a stateful message-passing graph, looping until a stopping condition is met (e.g., maximum number of turns).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- `ChatPromptTemplate` defines roles for generation and critique\n",
    "- `LangGraph` controls the flow between nodes (`generate â†’ reflect â†’ generate`)\n",
    "- Each node logs its output to show how the tweet evolves over time\n",
