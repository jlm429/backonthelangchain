    "  A search tool that retrieves up to 3 relevant articles from the web based on a user query. It's used to fetch current news or topic-specific content.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`summarize_text`**  \n",
    "  A simple summarization tool that truncates a block of text to 300 characters using Python’s built-in `textwrap` module. It ensures the agent provides concise responses.\n",

    "  Estimates how long it would take to read a given passage based on an average reading speed of 200 words per minute. The output is a rounded time in minutes.\n",

    "## Main Agent Loop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section initializes and runs the agent that processes user input to retrieve, analyze, and summarize recent news articles using LangChain's ReAct framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Setup:**\n",
    "  - A prompt template is defined to enforce a strict ReAct format: `Question → Thought → Action → Observation → Final Answer`.\n",
    "  - The final output is expected to be a markdown-formatted list with hyperlinks, summaries (max 20 words), reading levels, and reading times.\n",
    "  - Tools (`search`, `summarize_text`, `estimate_reading_time`, `estimate_reading_level`) are passed into the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM and Prompt Pipeline:**\n",
    "  - A `ChatOpenAI` model is instantiated and linked with the prompt and output parser (`ReActSingleInputOutputParser`).\n",
    "  - The prompt is dynamically formatted with tool names and descriptions.\n",
    "  - The agent is assembled using LangChain’s operator (`|`) syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Interaction:**\n",
    "  - The user is prompted for a topic of interest.\n",
    "  - This topic is used to formulate a search-and-summarize question, which is passed to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Execution Loop:**\n",
    "  - The loop continues while the agent produces `AgentAction` steps (i.e., tool invocations).\n",
    "  - For each action:\n",
    "    - The relevant tool is located and invoked.\n",
    "    - The result is printed and appended to the `intermediate_steps` scratchpad.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Output Formatting:**\n",
    "  - Once the agent concludes with a `FinalAnswer`, the system attempts to:\n",
    "    - Parse the Tavily search results JSON.\n",
    "    - Format each article into a markdown bullet point with:\n",
    "      - A clickable title\n",
    "      - A one-sentence summary (max 20 words)\n",
    "      - Estimated reading time\n",
    "      - Estimated reading level\n",
    "\n",
    "If the results are not from Tavily or parsing fails, a fallback message or raw output is shown."
